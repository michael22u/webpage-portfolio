                <p style="font-size:15px; text-align: justify;">The paintings, photographs and digital art of Michael Ungerer are of a subtle aesthetic that invites the viewer to look carefully at the picture. The spectrum of his artistic language ranges from abstract to realistic. Nature plays an important role in his works of art since he grew up in the countryside where he still lives today. But also the strangeness of the human body and its actions are a subject he deals with, which can be revealed, if it is captured in the right moment. A thorough observation of the chosen image motifs precedes mostly his works of art. He tries to create images that leave a lasting impression on the viewer and perhaps provoke a change of perspective on the subjects he depicts in his pictures.
                During his studies of contemporary art at the Free University of Bolzano, he participated in various projects that gave him an important insight into artistic practice.
